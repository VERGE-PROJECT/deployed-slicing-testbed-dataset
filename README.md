# Deployed Slicing Testbed Dataset

# Overview
D
eployed slicing dataset contains data related to the implementation, performance, and
optimization of network slicing in 5G networks. Network slicing allows operators to create
multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, each tailored to specific
applications. The dataset includes parameters such as latency, bandwidth, Quality of Service
(QoS) metrics, and resource allocation details. Its primary purpose is to facilitate research,
machine learning applications, and performance analysis, enabling improved network
management, resource allocation, and enhanced user experience in 5G use cases.

# Dataset Contents/Dataset Description
The data set includes various data metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to assess
network performance and efficiency. Key metrics include latency, which measures data
transmission delay, bandwidth for throughput capacity, and jitter to analyze variations in
packet arrival times. Other crucial KPIs include Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, such
as packet loss rate, reliability, and availability, ensuring optimal performance for different
slices. Additionally, resource utilization metrics like CPU, memory, and spectrum allocation
help in dynamic resource management. These metrics are essential for monitoring,
optimizing, and ensuring the reliability of 5G network slicing across diverse applications.


The dataset is provided in .csv and .xml format, so no special software or prerequisites
are required to access or use it.
